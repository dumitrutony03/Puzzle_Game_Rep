A little game made using Unity Engine and C# language that helped me learn more about OOP, designing an app and plan my ideas: think about them, realize how they will appear in the game and then try to implement them. I had a lot of fun working on this game, and managed to create a powerful passion for programming.

Puzzle go brrr
